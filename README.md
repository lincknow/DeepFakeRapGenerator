# DeepFakeRapGenerator
Here I will create a program that turns a sample of voice and some text into a rap at whatever BPM the user selects.

This program will be contributing to the good of humanity and therefore I would like anyone to be able to access the codebase in order to get inspired by the future of their own vocal sound and production. I wish everyone to be able to use this new technology however they want. However, I wish to enforce certain conditions on how the codebase is used, so I chose a copyleft license- the GNU General Public License (GPL). This license requires anyone who distributes this code or a derivative work to make their code available under the same license, ensuring that any modifications or improvements to my codebase are also open source.

This is so the music in the deep fake rap community can continue to build and thrive off examples, new songs, and technologies.
